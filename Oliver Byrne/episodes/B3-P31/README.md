# Byrne III.31 — the right angle stays right

First production test of the Manim contract in `../../manim-production.md`.

## Point of the Short

Keep the diameter fixed, move the third vertex continuously along the semicircle, and keep the right-angle marker/readout attached to the moving vertex. The Short is only testing the invariant in the first part of Euclid III.31; it does not expand into the acute/obtuse segment cases from the rest of the proposition.

The animation is an original parametric reconstruction. No C82 diagram, HTML/CSS, Joyce diagram, or Slyusarev implementation is copied into the scene.

## Languages

The episode source follows the repository's project-language rule:

- `scene.pi` is **Ithon** source;
- `render` is **Grease/YSH** glue;
- do not replace either with Python or Bash merely because Manim examples commonly use them.

Ithon is intentionally the language-facing layer for the Manim API here. The render entry point follows the same `#!/usr/bin/env ysh` Grease convention used elsewhere in the user's repositories.

## Reproduce

The render environment needs:

- Grease/YSH (`ysh`);
- an `ithon` executable on `PATH`;
- Manim Community **0.19.1** available to that Ithon runtime, including its Cairo rendering dependencies.

From the repository root:

```text
ysh './Oliver Byrne/episodes/B3-P31/render'
```

`scene.pi` checks the Manim version itself and renders at 1080×1920, 30 fps with Cairo. Generated media stays under this episode's ignored `media/` directory; the PR carries source, not a binary video.

Expected scene length is about 8.8 seconds.

The original contract test was rendered successfully before the source-language cleanup. That proved the visual/mathematical contract, but it does **not** count as validation of the present Ithon/Grease source. The temporary Bash/Python CI harness used for that test was removed rather than preserved as a hidden dependency. A future automated render should execute this same Ithon/Grease entry point.

## Geometry

Let the diameter endpoints be fixed points `B` and `C` on a circle and let `A` move on the upper semicircle. Every frame recomputes `AB`, `AC`, and the right-angle marker from the current position of `A`. This is the first claim of III.31: the angle `BAC` in the semicircle is right.
